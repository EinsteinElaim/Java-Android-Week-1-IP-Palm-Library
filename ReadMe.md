# Palm Library Android App - Week 1/4

### Author : Einstein Eliam

## Welcome to The Palm Library App - The internet's library on your palm!
<p>This app is designed to enable learners and curious minds to have a dedicated and simplified 
go-to app to poke around the internet in search of books on all genres and topics. The source to be
 implemented in this app will be the <a href="https://developers.google.com/books">Google Books API.</a></p>

### Capabilities:
<p>Users will be able to create an account for free, log in, choose preferences in genres or authors
 that they would like their feed to be randomly populated with, leave reviews, save books, open and 
 read various books that go for free in the API.</p>
